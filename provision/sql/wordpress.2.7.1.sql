at <a href=\"http://loopconf.io\">Loopconf</a> about the nature of a critical software bug.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>No strict mode on WordPress databases</h3>\n<p>At a base level, the problems originated in that WordPress did not enable strict mode for MySQL. If <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> has been enabled, the security vulnerability that was addressed in WordPress 4.2 would not exist.</p>\n<p>Without strict mode, MySQL allows more flexible inputs, and doesn&#8217;t require the same level of precision in what it allows. For example, a long username would just truncate to the maximum allowed characters, versus be rejected.</p>\n<p>Since MySQL can do strange things without strict mode enabled, there are obscure but significant ways for hackers to take advantage.</p>\n<h3>Defining the scope of a vulnerability</h3>\n<p>A vulnerability was disclosed to the WordPress security team about two years ago.

If <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> has been enabled, the security vulnerability that was addressed in WordPress 4.2 would not exist.</p>\n<p>Without strict mode, MySQL allows more flexible inputs, and doesn&#8217;t require the same level of precision in what it allows. For example, a long username would just truncate to the maximum allowed characters, versus be rejected.</p>\n<p>Since MySQL can do strange things without strict mode enabled, there are obscure but significant ways for hackers to take advantage.</p>\n<h3>Defining the scope of a vulnerability</h3>\n<p>A vulnerability was disclosed to the WordPress security team about two years ago.

You will not be an accessibility expert after reading this, not even a ninja! But I&#8217;d like to share what I have learned about accessibility in WordPress Themes. Hopefully that&#8217;ll help someone to build more accessible themes, and we can share ideas of how to make the web better place for all of us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned most of my knowledge from <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a> and <a href=\"http://davidakennedy.com/\">David A. Kennedy</a>. They both contribute to the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/\">WordPress Accessibility Team</a> and have been kindly answering my questions on Github and Twitter. Our goal is to understand the basics of accessibility and how we can prepare our themes to receive the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag.</p>\n<h3>What is accessibility and why should we care?</h3>\n<p>Web <strong>accessibility means that people can browse the web</strong>, with or without disabilities, using any device they might have. In this article, I mostly concentrate on people with disabilities including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. We can improve our sites and help such people use, navigate, and interact with them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/viljamis\">Viljami Salminen</a> talks about different input methods and performance in his article called <a href=\"http://viljamis.com/blog/2015/the-many-faces-of-the-web/\">The Many Faces of the Web</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On a bigger scale, I mean things like making our websites accessible to everyone. Making them work with different input methods like touch, mouse, keyboard or voice. Making them load and perform fast. Providing everyone access to this vast network of connected things. And if we don’t strive for all of this, what’s the point of working on the web?</p></blockquote>\n<p>If nothing else, you should care about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbbuaIA3Ds\">money</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brad_frost\">Brad Frost</a> nails it in his article about <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/accessibility-and-low-powered-devices/\">accessibility and low-powered devices</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Do you want to reach more customers?” the answer is always yes. When I ask them “Do you want your experience to load blazingly fast?” the answer is always yes. Both accessibility and performance are invisible aspects of an experience and should be considered even if they aren’t explicit goals of the project.</p>\n<p>There it is. Make efforts to make Web experiences accessible and performant; make money.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required</a> parts of the puzzle.</p>\n<h3>.screen-reader-text for hiding text</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.screen-reader-text</code> is actually not required but I&#8217;ll use it in several examples. WordPress uses the CSS class <code>.screen-reader-text</code> to handle any HTML output that is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/02/09/hiding-text-for-screen-readers-with-wordpress-core/\">targeted at screen readers</a>. The purpose of screen-reader targeted text is to provide <strong>additional context</strong> for links, document structure, or form fields. This is helpful for whoever is using screen readers when browsing the web.</p>\n<p>Since WordPress 4.2, the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class is used in front-end code also, not just back-end. For example <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comments_popup_link\">comments_popup_link()</a> can output something like this by default:</p>\n<p><code>4 Comments&lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt; on My article about accessibility&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Did you notice the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class? The text <em>on My article about accessibility</em> is supposed to be hidden on screen but readable for screen readers. This provides additional information about what <em>4 Comments</em> stands for and which article we&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have .screen-reader-text in your theme&#8217;s style.css that&#8217;s okay too. Then all users in this scenario would see the entire text (<em>4 Comments on My article about accessibility</em>), but nothing is broken. Naturally there is a plugin for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/screen-reader-text-theme-support/\">adding support for .screen-reader-text</a> as well.</p>\n<h4>Add .screen-reader-text in your theme&#8217;s style.css</h4>\n<p>The following snippet is the recommended method for adding a screen-reader class in your theme&#8217;s styles at the moment. You can also follow <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">the Underscores theme</a> for this and other recommended methods.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>You can style the <code>:focus</code> styles differently but this a solid start.</p>\n<h3>Headings and headings hierarchy structure</h3>\n<p>Headings are important way to navigate your site. They are the first step most screen reader users take when they start to navigate your site. And regular users can also browse the a website more easily when there are structured headings.</p>\n<p>But headings and heading hierarchy structure can be challenging, I certainly have had <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/kuorinka/issues/18\">issues with headings</a> in my personal experience. Should we use just one H1 element on each page? Can there be more than one H1? What about other headings: H2, H3 and so on?</p>\n<p>With the acceptance of HTML5 standards, there can be more than one H1 on each page, but it&#8217;s important to be consistent with your headings hierarchy. Here is example of my blog page headings structure:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>And again for single posts:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>The problem is that the headings hierarchy breaks if a user enters H1 in the article text or mixes headings in the wrong way. Plugins that output markup may also mess with the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Read more detail info about <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2014/11/headings-hierarchy-problem/\">heading hierarchy structure</a> and be consistent in your theme. And as a writer, think about the hierarchy structure of your theme and try not to break it. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>ARIA landmark roles</h3>\n<p>Aria landmark roles programmatically identify sections of a page. This helps navigate to various sections of a page for assistive technology users.</p>\n<p>These are the most common roles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>header: <code>role=\"banner\"</code></li>\n<li>main content: <code>role=\"main\"</code></li>\n<li>sidebars: <code>role=\"complementary\"</code></li>\n<li>footer: <code>role=\"contentinfo\"</code></li>\n<li>search form: <code>role=\"search\"</code></li>\n<li>navigation menus: <code>role=\"navigation\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the same role appears more than once on a page, you should provide an ARIA label for that role:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Try not to use too many ARIA landmark roles. Otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be helpful for screen reader users to navigate your site. Ten to fifteen roles is probably a good rule of thumb as a maximum limit.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example for how your HTML structure could look with ARIA roles:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>An the screenshot from <a href=\"http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/aria-landmark-inspector/\">Aria landmark inspector</a> website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aria-landmark.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12538\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aria-landmark-752x526.png\" alt=\"Aria Landmarks\" width=\"752\" height=\"526\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Link text</h3>\n<p>Imagine your blog archive using ten <em>Read More&#8230;</em> links. That&#8217;s not very helpful for screen reader users browsing trough your links. In general, avoid repetitive non-contextual text strings.</p>\n<h4>Using the_content() function</h4>\n<p>By default <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_content\"><code>the_content()</code></a> function outputs <em>more&amp;hellip;</em> text when using &lt;!&#8211;more&#8211;&gt; in post content. Fortunately, you can change this output using the function&#8217;s first parameter: <code>$more_link_text</code>. It&#8217;s recommended to use the post title for additional context:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>This will output <code>Read more &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;My Article Name&lt;/span&gt;</code>, not just the repetitive <em>Read More</em>. Note that we&#8217;re using class <code>screen-reader-text</code> again, which means that the post title can be hidden (if theme supports it), but screen readers will still read it.</p>\n<h4>Using the_excerpt() function</h4>\n<p>By default <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt\">the_excerpt()</a> function adds <code>[...]</code> to the end of the excerpt. We can replace with something similar to what we used in <code>the_content</code> example, using the <code>excerpt_more</code> filter.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>That&#8217;s more like it. You can change the HTML structure, but you get the general idea how we added post title after the default text.</p>\n<h4>Descriptive link text</h4>\n<p>Try to be descriptive when using link text, and bare urls should not be used as link anchor text.</p>\n<p>Bad example:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Good example:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<h3>Controls</h3>\n<p>Let links be links, buttons be buttons, divs be divs, spans be spans to ensure native keyboard accessibility and interaction with a screen reader. Article <a href=\"http://www.karlgroves.com/2013/05/14/links-are-not-buttons-neither-are-divs-and-spans/\">links are not buttons. Neither are divs and spans</a>.</p>\n<p>All controls must also have text to indicate the nature of the control, but it too can be hidden inside the <code>.screen-reader-class</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, when toggling a menu, the control should be a button, not a link, div or span.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>You can always style the button using CSS. Many theme developers add a font icon indicating the menu, like the commonly named &#8220;hamburger menu.&#8221; This is a bad way of adding the font icon:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Font icons alone don&#8217;t have any meaning for screen readers. In general <a href=\"http://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label\">the best icon is a text label</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead you could do this:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Then add the icon font using a pseudo element, such as <code>#nav-toggle::before</code>.</p>\n<p>You can also use the icon font and <code>.screen-reader-text</code> together.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Sighted users will see only the hamburger icon, and screen reader users will now understand that this control is for the menu.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard navigation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/\">On ThemeShaper</a>, there is fantastic article about <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/2015/03/12/keyboard-accessibility/\">keyboard accessibility</a>. In short, <strong>users must be able to navigate your site using only a keyboard</strong>. For example people who are blind or have motor disabilities use the keyboard almost exclusively.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to challenge you to put your mouse away for a while and test your own website. Can you navigate through links, dropdown menu and form controls using the tab and shift + tab keys? Enter can be used to activate links, buttons, or other interactive elements.</p>\n<h4>:focus is important</h4>\n<p>Note that only links, buttons and form fields can be focused on by default. That&#8217;s why I keep noting that we should let links be links and buttons be buttons. Don&#8217;t try to replace them with divs or spans. Users should see and elements should have visual effects to notate their state when they navigate your site using a keyboard. This is where :focus steps in.</p>\n<p>This is a poor implementation:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>That disables outline style for all links! This is much better:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Now users have a visual effect &#8212; a dotted line around the link &#8212; on links when focused. You can style the thin dotted to something else, but do not disable it. Remember that you can of course style buttons using CSS also, for example to change the background on :focus.</p>\n<p>Make sure that colors are not your only method of conveying important information. That will help color blind people to see visual effects.</p>\n<h4>Dropdown menus and keyboard accessibility</h4>\n<p>Have you tried accessing your submenus in a dropdown menu using only keyboard? If you can&#8217;t successfully do so, let&#8217;s see what we can do about that, starting with the current <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#keyboard-navigation\">guidelines for navigation menus</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using <code>display:none;</code> and brought into view on <code>:hover</code></li>\n<li>Passes: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using <code>position: absolute;</code> and brought into view on <code>:hover </code>and <code>:focus</code>, and are navigable using the <code>tab</code> key</li>\n<li>Better: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using position: absolute; and brought into view on <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, and are navigable using either the <code>tab</code> key or by using the keyboard arrow keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once again, the <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a> theme has a good example of dropdown menu markup which is navigable using the <code>tab</code> key. I&#8217;ll hope there will be support for arrow keys in near future. I personally use <a href=\"http://responsive-nav.com/\">Responsive Nav</a> as a starting point for accessible, responsive menus.</p>\n<p>We need some Javascript magic for enabling keyboard support for dropdown menus. For reference, checkout this <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/master/js/navigation.js\">navigation.js file</a>. This is the basic idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each time a menu link is focused or blurred, set or remove the <code>.focus</code> class on the menu link. This is done with the <code>toggleFocus()</code> function.</li>\n<li>Add class <code>.focus</code> your stylesheet, where you have <code>:hover</code> styles for the menu.</li>\n<li>You can now navigate your menu and submenus using the <code>tab</code> and <code>Shift + tab</code> key!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some other aspects we should consider for more accessible dropdown menus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use ARIA markup like aria-haspopup=&#8221;true&#8221; in menu items that have submenus.</li>\n<li>What about touch devices? Have you tried accessing submenus using iPad when menu is in &#8220;Desktop&#8221; mode? I believe touch support is also coming to the Underscores theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There could be another in-depth article for creating accessible, responsive menus so I&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<h3>Contrasts</h3>\n<p>Color contrast is something we might have to compromise on in our design. We need to provide enough contrast between text and background colors so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision. There are many beautiful themes out there that use for example light grey colors but might not pass the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#contrasts\">guideline for color contrast</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Theme authors MUST ensure that all background/foreground color contrasts for plain content text are within the level AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) specified in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for color luminosity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I test color contrast using Joe Dolson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/tools/color-contrast.php\">tester tool</a>. Accessibility doesn&#8217;t make your site ugly or boring, that&#8217;s always you. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> But it does set some preconditions we need to follow. Aaron Jorbin also has a great <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2014/07/01/aaron-jorbin-color-theory-for-web-developers/\">talk on color theory and accessibility</a> from WordCamp Chicago 2014.</p>\n<h3>Skip links</h3>\n<p>A website&#8217;s primary content is usually not at the top of the page. There can be dropdown menus, header sidebars, search forms or other information before the main content. For keyboard and screen reader users it&#8217;s annoying to navigate this extra content over and over again before arriving at the main content. That&#8217;s why themes must have skip links, which help to navigate directly to content. The skip link is usually added in the header.php file after the body or first div tag.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Make sure the link is one of the first items on the page and visible when keyboard focus moves to the link. We already did that when we added .screen-reader-text class in our stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Also move focus to the main content area of the page when skip link is activated. I believe there is still a bug in WebKit-based browsers that prevents focus being moved, but once again, <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/master/js/skip-link-focus-fix.js\">the Underscores theme has you covered</a> offering a good example.</p>\n<h3>Forms</h3>\n<p>WordPress default comment and search forms are accessible-ready, but be careful if you tweak them. I have made mistakes doing so in the past.</p>\n<p>Hiding the search button using <code>.search-submit { display: none; }</code>. <strong>Do not use this CSS if you want the content to be read by a screen reader.</strong></p>\n<p>A better option is the filter <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_search_form\">get_search_form</a>, and add our now familiar <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class to the search form&#8217;s submit button.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>If you use a custom <code>searchform.php</code> in your theme, remember to keep appropriate field labels and do not use only a font icon as the submit button.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>In short from <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#forms\">the guidelines</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Use form controls that have explicitly associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements.</li>\n<li>Create feedback mechanisms (such as via AJAX) that expose responses to screen readers. Look at techniques with ARIA for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also keep an eye on a <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns\">collection of patterns</a> for creating accessible-ready WordPress themes. Like <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns/tree/master/comment-form-with-js-aria\">an accessible comment</a> form powered by JavaScript and ARIA.</p>\n<h3>Images and alternative text</h3>\n<p>As a user I&#8217;ve failed to add alternative (alt attribute) text to my content images, at least good ones. I promise to improve! You see, blind people of course can&#8217;t see your content images. Computers and screen readers can&#8217;t determine what the image presents. That&#8217;s why there is alt attribute and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#images\">guidelines for images</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are images in template markup, like features images, they must utilize the alt attribute. Or provide the end user to enter alt text.</li>\n<li>All decorative images should be added via CSS versus inline. Examples of decorative images are  lines for style or background images.</li>\n<li>Note that sometimes an empty alt=&#8221;&#8221; is <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/\">the best choice</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Media</h3>\n<p>Sliders and carousels must not auto start by default. The same goes for videos and audios. This is mostly plugin territory, but it&#8217;s good to mention, especially as the broader web is more and more often auto-playing this content.</p>\n<h3>Not allowed</h3>\n<p>There are couple of things that are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#not-allowed\">not allowed</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Any positive tabindex attribute. Negative or zero value tabindex is allowed in specific circumstances (assessed on a case-by-case basis).</li>\n<li>The inclusion of the accesskey attribute.</li>\n<li>Spawning new windows or tabs without warning the user.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Build accessibility-ready themes</h3>\n<p>We have gone through the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required guidelines</a> for getting the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag in our themes when we submit them to the WordPress theme repository. It wasn&#8217;t that bad was it!</p>\n<p>I challenge you to build an accessibility-ready theme when you start your next project. Or look into your current site and start with small steps, like adding better support for keyboard users. I hope this article will help you do that. Let me know in the comments if there are mistakes in the article, you have questions, or you have ideas for part two.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter are you building themes for customers, commercial themes for marketplaces or free themes for WordPress.org. We can all improve our skills and create more accessible websites.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>About the author: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/sami-keijonen/\">Sami Keijonen</a> is a teacher who likes to learn about the web, WordPress, and life.

You will not be an accessibility expert after reading this, not even a ninja! But I&#8217;d like to share what I have learned about accessibility in WordPress Themes. Hopefully that&#8217;ll help someone to build more accessible themes, and we can share ideas of how to make the web better place for all of us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned most of my knowledge from <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a> and <a href=\"http://davidakennedy.com/\">David A. Kennedy</a>. They both contribute to the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/\">WordPress Accessibility Team</a> and have been kindly answering my questions on Github and Twitter. Our goal is to understand the basics of accessibility and how we can prepare our themes to receive the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag.</p>\n<h3>What is accessibility and why should we care?</h3>\n<p>Web <strong>accessibility means that people can browse the web</strong>, with or without disabilities, using any device they might have. In this article, I mostly concentrate on people with disabilities including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. We can improve our sites and help such people use, navigate, and interact with them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/viljamis\">Viljami Salminen</a> talks about different input methods and performance in his article called <a href=\"http://viljamis.com/blog/2015/the-many-faces-of-the-web/\">The Many Faces of the Web</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On a bigger scale, I mean things like making our websites accessible to everyone. Making them work with different input methods like touch, mouse, keyboard or voice. Making them load and perform fast. Providing everyone access to this vast network of connected things. And if we don’t strive for all of this, what’s the point of working on the web?</p></blockquote>\n<p>If nothing else, you should care about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbbuaIA3Ds\">money</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brad_frost\">Brad Frost</a> nails it in his article about <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/accessibility-and-low-powered-devices/\">accessibility and low-powered devices</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Do you want to reach more customers?” the answer is always yes. When I ask them “Do you want your experience to load blazingly fast?” the answer is always yes. Both accessibility and performance are invisible aspects of an experience and should be considered even if they aren’t explicit goals of the project.</p>\n<p>There it is. Make efforts to make Web experiences accessible and performant; make money.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required</a> parts of the puzzle.</p>\n<h3>.screen-reader-text for hiding text</h3>\n<p>Using <code>.screen-reader-text</code> is actually not required but I&#8217;ll use it in several examples. WordPress uses the CSS class <code>.screen-reader-text</code> to handle any HTML output that is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/02/09/hiding-text-for-screen-readers-with-wordpress-core/\">targeted at screen readers</a>. The purpose of screen-reader targeted text is to provide <strong>additional context</strong> for links, document structure, or form fields. This is helpful for whoever is using screen readers when browsing the web.</p>\n<p>Since WordPress 4.2, the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class is used in front-end code also, not just back-end. For example <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comments_popup_link\">comments_popup_link()</a> can output something like this by default:</p>\n<p><code>4 Comments&lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt; on My article about accessibility&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Did you notice the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class? The text <em>on My article about accessibility</em> is supposed to be hidden on screen but readable for screen readers. This provides additional information about what <em>4 Comments</em> stands for and which article we&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have .screen-reader-text in your theme&#8217;s style.css that&#8217;s okay too. Then all users in this scenario would see the entire text (<em>4 Comments on My article about accessibility</em>), but nothing is broken. Naturally there is a plugin for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/screen-reader-text-theme-support/\">adding support for .screen-reader-text</a> as well.</p>\n<h4>Add .screen-reader-text in your theme&#8217;s style.css</h4>\n<p>The following snippet is the recommended method for adding a screen-reader class in your theme&#8217;s styles at the moment. You can also follow <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">the Underscores theme</a> for this and other recommended methods.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>You can style the <code>:focus</code> styles differently but this a solid start.</p>\n<h3>Headings and headings hierarchy structure</h3>\n<p>Headings are important way to navigate your site. They are the first step most screen reader users take when they start to navigate your site. And regular users can also browse the a website more easily when there are structured headings.</p>\n<p>But headings and heading hierarchy structure can be challenging, I certainly have had <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/kuorinka/issues/18\">issues with headings</a> in my personal experience. Should we use just one H1 element on each page? Can there be more than one H1? What about other headings: H2, H3 and so on?</p>\n<p>With the acceptance of HTML5 standards, there can be more than one H1 on each page, but it&#8217;s important to be consistent with your headings hierarchy. Here is example of my blog page headings structure:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>And again for single posts:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>The problem is that the headings hierarchy breaks if a user enters H1 in the article text or mixes headings in the wrong way. Plugins that output markup may also mess with the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Read more detail info about <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2014/11/headings-hierarchy-problem/\">heading hierarchy structure</a> and be consistent in your theme. And as a writer, think about the hierarchy structure of your theme and try not to break it. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>ARIA landmark roles</h3>\n<p>Aria landmark roles programmatically identify sections of a page. This helps navigate to various sections of a page for assistive technology users.</p>\n<p>These are the most common roles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>header: <code>role=\"banner\"</code></li>\n<li>main content: <code>role=\"main\"</code></li>\n<li>sidebars: <code>role=\"complementary\"</code></li>\n<li>footer: <code>role=\"contentinfo\"</code></li>\n<li>search form: <code>role=\"search\"</code></li>\n<li>navigation menus: <code>role=\"navigation\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the same role appears more than once on a page, you should provide an ARIA label for that role:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Try not to use too many ARIA landmark roles. Otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be helpful for screen reader users to navigate your site. Ten to fifteen roles is probably a good rule of thumb as a maximum limit.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example for how your HTML structure could look with ARIA roles:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>An the screenshot from <a href=\"http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/aria-landmark-inspector/\">Aria landmark inspector</a> website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aria-landmark.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12538\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aria-landmark-752x526.png\" alt=\"Aria Landmarks\" width=\"752\" height=\"526\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Link text</h3>\n<p>Imagine your blog archive using ten <em>Read More&#8230;</em> links. That&#8217;s not very helpful for screen reader users browsing trough your links. In general, avoid repetitive non-contextual text strings.</p>\n<h4>Using the_content() function</h4>\n<p>By default <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_content\"><code>the_content()</code></a> function outputs <em>more&amp;hellip;</em> text when using &lt;!&#8211;more&#8211;&gt; in post content. Fortunately, you can change this output using the function&#8217;s first parameter: <code>$more_link_text</code>. It&#8217;s recommended to use the post title for additional context:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>This will output <code>Read more &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;My Article Name&lt;/span&gt;</code>, not just the repetitive <em>Read More</em>. Note that we&#8217;re using class <code>screen-reader-text</code> again, which means that the post title can be hidden (if theme supports it), but screen readers will still read it.</p>\n<h4>Using the_excerpt() function</h4>\n<p>By default <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt\">the_excerpt()</a> function adds <code>[...]</code> to the end of the excerpt. We can replace with something similar to what we used in <code>the_content</code> example, using the <code>excerpt_more</code> filter.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>That&#8217;s more like it. You can change the HTML structure, but you get the general idea how we added post title after the default text.</p>\n<h4>Descriptive link text</h4>\n<p>Try to be descriptive when using link text, and bare urls should not be used as link anchor text.</p>\n<p>Bad example:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Good example:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<h3>Controls</h3>\n<p>Let links be links, buttons be buttons, divs be divs, spans be spans to ensure native keyboard accessibility and interaction with a screen reader. Article <a href=\"http://www.karlgroves.com/2013/05/14/links-are-not-buttons-neither-are-divs-and-spans/\">links are not buttons. Neither are divs and spans</a>.</p>\n<p>All controls must also have text to indicate the nature of the control, but it too can be hidden inside the <code>.screen-reader-class</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, when toggling a menu, the control should be a button, not a link, div or span.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>You can always style the button using CSS. Many theme developers add a font icon indicating the menu, like the commonly named &#8220;hamburger menu.&#8221; This is a bad way of adding the font icon:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Font icons alone don&#8217;t have any meaning for screen readers. In general <a href=\"http://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label\">the best icon is a text label</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead you could do this:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Then add the icon font using a pseudo element, such as <code>#nav-toggle::before</code>.</p>\n<p>You can also use the icon font and <code>.screen-reader-text</code> together.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Sighted users will see only the hamburger icon, and screen reader users will now understand that this control is for the menu.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard navigation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/\">On ThemeShaper</a>, there is fantastic article about <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/2015/03/12/keyboard-accessibility/\">keyboard accessibility</a>. In short, <strong>users must be able to navigate your site using only a keyboard</strong>. For example people who are blind or have motor disabilities use the keyboard almost exclusively.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to challenge you to put your mouse away for a while and test your own website. Can you navigate through links, dropdown menu and form controls using the tab and shift + tab keys? Enter can be used to activate links, buttons, or other interactive elements.</p>\n<h4>:focus is important</h4>\n<p>Note that only links, buttons and form fields can be focused on by default. That&#8217;s why I keep noting that we should let links be links and buttons be buttons. Don&#8217;t try to replace them with divs or spans. Users should see and elements should have visual effects to notate their state when they navigate your site using a keyboard. This is where :focus steps in.</p>\n<p>This is a poor implementation:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>That disables outline style for all links! This is much better:</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Now users have a visual effect &#8212; a dotted line around the link &#8212; on links when focused. You can style the thin dotted to something else, but do not disable it. Remember that you can of course style buttons using CSS also, for example to change the background on :focus.</p>\n<p>Make sure that colors are not your only method of conveying important information. That will help color blind people to see visual effects.</p>\n<h4>Dropdown menus and keyboard accessibility</h4>\n<p>Have you tried accessing your submenus in a dropdown menu using only keyboard? If you can&#8217;t successfully do so, let&#8217;s see what we can do about that, starting with the current <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#keyboard-navigation\">guidelines for navigation menus</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using <code>display:none;</code> and brought into view on <code>:hover</code></li>\n<li>Passes: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using <code>position: absolute;</code> and brought into view on <code>:hover </code>and <code>:focus</code>, and are navigable using the <code>tab</code> key</li>\n<li>Better: Dropdown navigation menus are hidden using position: absolute; and brought into view on <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, and are navigable using either the <code>tab</code> key or by using the keyboard arrow keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once again, the <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a> theme has a good example of dropdown menu markup which is navigable using the <code>tab</code> key. I&#8217;ll hope there will be support for arrow keys in near future. I personally use <a href=\"http://responsive-nav.com/\">Responsive Nav</a> as a starting point for accessible, responsive menus.</p>\n<p>We need some Javascript magic for enabling keyboard support for dropdown menus. For reference, checkout this <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/master/js/navigation.js\">navigation.js file</a>. This is the basic idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each time a menu link is focused or blurred, set or remove the <code>.focus</code> class on the menu link. This is done with the <code>toggleFocus()</code> function.</li>\n<li>Add class <code>.focus</code> your stylesheet, where you have <code>:hover</code> styles for the menu.</li>\n<li>You can now navigate your menu and submenus using the <code>tab</code> and <code>Shift + tab</code> key!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some other aspects we should consider for more accessible dropdown menus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use ARIA markup like aria-haspopup=&#8221;true&#8221; in menu items that have submenus.</li>\n<li>What about touch devices? Have you tried accessing submenus using iPad when menu is in &#8220;Desktop&#8221; mode? I believe touch support is also coming to the Underscores theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There could be another in-depth article for creating accessible, responsive menus so I&#8217;ll move on.</p>\n<h3>Contrasts</h3>\n<p>Color contrast is something we might have to compromise on in our design. We need to provide enough contrast between text and background colors so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision. There are many beautiful themes out there that use for example light grey colors but might not pass the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#contrasts\">guideline for color contrast</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Theme authors MUST ensure that all background/foreground color contrasts for plain content text are within the level AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) specified in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for color luminosity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I test color contrast using Joe Dolson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/tools/color-contrast.php\">tester tool</a>. Accessibility doesn&#8217;t make your site ugly or boring, that&#8217;s always you. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> But it does set some preconditions we need to follow. Aaron Jorbin also has a great <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2014/07/01/aaron-jorbin-color-theory-for-web-developers/\">talk on color theory and accessibility</a> from WordCamp Chicago 2014.</p>\n<h3>Skip links</h3>\n<p>A website&#8217;s primary content is usually not at the top of the page. There can be dropdown menus, header sidebars, search forms or other information before the main content. For keyboard and screen reader users it&#8217;s annoying to navigate this extra content over and over again before arriving at the main content. That&#8217;s why themes must have skip links, which help to navigate directly to content. The skip link is usually added in the header.php file after the body or first div tag.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>Make sure the link is one of the first items on the page and visible when keyboard focus moves to the link. We already did that when we added .screen-reader-text class in our stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Also move focus to the main content area of the page when skip link is activated. I believe there is still a bug in WebKit-based browsers that prevents focus being moved, but once again, <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/master/js/skip-link-focus-fix.js\">the Underscores theme has you covered</a> offering a good example.</p>\n<h3>Forms</h3>\n<p>WordPress default comment and search forms are accessible-ready, but be careful if you tweak them. I have made mistakes doing so in the past.</p>\n<p>Hiding the search button using <code>.search-submit { display: none; }</code>. <strong>Do not use this CSS if you want the content to be read by a screen reader.</strong></p>\n<p>A better option is the filter <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_search_form\">get_search_form</a>, and add our now familiar <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class to the search form&#8217;s submit button.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>If you use a custom <code>searchform.php</code> in your theme, remember to keep appropriate field labels and do not use only a font icon as the submit button.</p>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bee3e380c614542776de\" target=\"_blank\"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>In short from <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#forms\">the guidelines</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Use form controls that have explicitly associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements.</li>\n<li>Create feedback mechanisms (such as via AJAX) that expose responses to screen readers. Look at techniques with ARIA for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also keep an eye on a <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns\">collection of patterns</a> for creating accessible-ready WordPress themes. Like <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns/tree/master/comment-form-with-js-aria\">an accessible comment</a> form powered by JavaScript and ARIA.</p>\n<h3>Images and alternative text</h3>\n<p>As a user I&#8217;ve failed to add alternative (alt attribute) text to my content images, at least good ones. I promise to improve! You see, blind people of course can&#8217;t see your content images. Computers and screen readers can&#8217;t determine what the image presents. That&#8217;s why there is alt attribute and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#images\">guidelines for images</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are images in template markup, like features images, they must utilize the alt attribute. Or provide the end user to enter alt text.</li>\n<li>All decorative images should be added via CSS versus inline. Examples of decorative images are  lines for style or background images.</li>\n<li>Note that sometimes an empty alt=&#8221;&#8221; is <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/\">the best choice</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Media</h3>\n<p>Sliders and carousels must not auto start by default. The same goes for videos and audios. This is mostly plugin territory, but it&#8217;s good to mention, especially as the broader web is more and more often auto-playing this content.</p>\n<h3>Not allowed</h3>\n<p>There are couple of things that are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#not-allowed\">not allowed</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Any positive tabindex attribute. Negative or zero value tabindex is allowed in specific circumstances (assessed on a case-by-case basis).</li>\n<li>The inclusion of the accesskey attribute.</li>\n<li>Spawning new windows or tabs without warning the user.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Build accessibility-ready themes</h3>\n<p>We have gone through the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required guidelines</a> for getting the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag in our themes when we submit them to the WordPress theme repository. It wasn&#8217;t that bad was it!</p>\n<p>I challenge you to build an accessibility-ready theme when you start your next project. Or look into your current site and start with small steps, like adding better support for keyboard users. I hope this article will help you do that. Let me know in the comments if there are mistakes in the article, you have questions, or you have ideas for part two.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter are you building themes for customers, commercial themes for marketplaces or free themes for WordPress.org. We can all improve our skills and create more accessible websites.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>About the author: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/sami-keijonen/\">Sami Keijonen</a> is a teacher who likes to learn about the web, WordPress, and life.

This release will add support for installing from a GitHub repo source, separate menu items out from under the Appearance menu, add Travis CI support, improve accessibility, and fix a number of bugs.</p>\n<h3>The Future of the TGM Plugin Activation Library</h3>\n<p>The project&#8217;s contributors are also planning ahead for this summer&#8217;s 3.0 release, which Folmer will lead. This release will be a major turning point for TGMPA and will essentially constitute a complete rewrite.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/394\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for 3.0</a> includes several ambitious items that will likely affect the way developers integrate TGMPA into their projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisite compatibility</li>\n<li>Fix conflicting UI messages for usage in themes / plugins</li>\n<li>Improved UI by having the admin page always in the same location</li>\n<li>Updatability of TGMPA independently of the plugin/theme which ships it</li>\n<li>Show dependencies more clearly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This plan includes an architectural change that would allow for the integration of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-dependencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Plugin Dependencies</a> (PD) plugin to provide UI for dependency management and cascading deactivation if dependencies are not met.</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the eventual goal is to turn TGMPA into a plugin that can be added to the WordPress.org repository for easier updating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of the logic in the rewrite will be handled by the Plugin Dependencies plugin, and TGMPA itself will be turned into a plugin and added to the WPORG repo so that it can be updated automatically. The TGMPA library will then consist of a bootstrap file, the TGMPA plugin (as a zip) and the PD plugin (as a zip). The bootstrap file will then check if the TGMPA + PD plugins are installed, and if not, install them from the embedded zips.</p></blockquote>\n<p>TGMPA contributors are currently in discussion with representatives from WordPress.org about the possibility of allowing their planned plugin in the official directory. As the plugin has not yet been produced and submitted, it&#8217;s still too early to know the outcome of the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we can&#8217;t go onto the WordPress.org repo, then we&#8217;ll be looking at simply hosting the plugin version on GitHub, and use some (if needed) of the GitHub Updater plugin (or similar) code within the bootstrap file to pull the latest tag from GitHub instead,&#8221; Jones said.</p>\n<p>One of the main focuses for version 3.0 is to allow different plugins and themes to use TGMPA without the concern of compatibilities resulting from plugin A including 2.4.1, for example, and plugin B including 2.5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The v3 setup should also be able to handle instances of v2 gracefully, and the v2 branch may have a 2.6 release to make the logic for that easier,&#8221; Jones said.</p>\n<p>After version 3.0 is released, the project will contain multiple repositories &#8211; one for the standard plugin, and one that uses Grunt to pull in files from the plugin repository and zips them up next to the bootstrap file. In anticipation of these changes, contributors have moved the current repository into a new GitHub organization at: <a href=\"https://github.com/TGMPA\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/TGMPA</a>.</p>\n<p>As TGMPA does not currently track its usage, it&#8217;s difficult to nail down exact numbers for how many theme/plugin developers these changes will impact.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have no idea what sort of numbers of products this entails,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;But there is a non-trivial amount of usage that requires us to step up the game in order to provide the exceptional functionality other developers can rely on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>TGMPA is a critical tool that many developers in the WordPress ecosystem depend on for managing plugin requirements and recommendations. As theme development continues to move in the direction of separating theme and plugin functionality, TGMPA will play an important role in serving developers who want to structure their projects according to WordPress best practices.</p>\n<p>Getting the new TGMPA plugin included in the WordPress.org plugin directory would be a big win for the project, as it would allow users to update more easily in the future.

You can see this API in action alongside the newly improved <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6290/\" target=\"_blank\">avatar upload UI</a>, revamped to include drag-and-drop upload and support for device cameras.</p>\n<p>This release will also ship with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-will-introduce-companion-stylesheets-for-wordpress-default-themes\" target=\"_blank\">companion stylesheets for WordPress&#8217; latest default themes</a>, Twenty Fifteen and Twenty Fourteen. These stylesheets provide a broad sweep on BP elements to harmonize the appearance of the plugin with the default themes and could use more testing and feedback from the community.</p>\n<p>Jacoby noted a few other important items to test in 2.3 beta 1, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6177/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Post Activity</a> generates better looking excerpts when posts contain images or other embedded media content</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6331/\" target=\"_blank\">Star Private Messages</a> allows for improved marking of important inbox messages</li>\n<li>The Member Types API now supports <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6286\" target=\"_blank\">member-type-specific directories</a></li>\n<li>Continued object and query cache enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BuddyPress developers and community managers have plenty of time to test their themes and plugins against the upcoming 2.3 release. A release candidate is scheduled for the week of May 12th. The official release is expected to drop May 26th, shortly before the BuddyCamp that will take place at WordCamp Miami 2015.</p>\";}i:7;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 191 – Proven Guilty by a Washing Machine\";s:4:\"guid\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=43443&preview_id=43443\";s:4:\"link\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-191-proven-guilty-by-a-washing-machine\";s:11:\"description\";s:2901:\"<p>On this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the news of the week.

Founder Michael Eisenwasser launched the business in 2010 after discovering BuddyPress while building an international job site to help online workers find employment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;BuddyPress blew me away,&#8221; Eisenwasser said. &#8220;It allowed for a sophisticated and fully customizable membership site while still benefiting from the WordPress ecosystem. We launched our online community almost overnight, and a year later 30,000 people were logging in every day and hiring each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BuddyBoss entered the BuddyPress ecosystem while it was still in its infancy. Eisenwasser saw an opportunity to help other entrepreneurs launch communities by creating products that solved common problems. In addition to the products, his team also offers development for custom requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been focusing on BuddyPress for so long now that I sometimes forget you can run WordPress without it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Growing a Business in a Small Niche</h3>\n<p>As BuddyBoss products are targeted towards a small niche market, hiring has posed a continual challenge for Eisenwasser.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A company is only as good as its employees, and our biggest challenge has always been finding the right people to hire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need talented people who can move the company forward, knowing that we’re in a niche market and skilled developers who understand BuddyPress are harder to find.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s taken us many years to put together our current staff, and even now I still spend a considerable amount of time on hiring and training.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The BudddyBoss team is now up to 14 people who collaborate on design, development, support, and marketing. They currently serve several thousand customers, thanks to tremendous growth over the past couple of years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue is 12.5 times larger today than it was three years ago, and most of that growth has been in the past year,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the past 6 months, product revenue has grown 5 times larger due to improved product offerings, word of mouth from our customers, and better marketing. When I speak of products, I am combining themes and extensions together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently we have several thousand paying customers, with an average checkout order of $130. Many customers purchase two or three products in one order, as we design our themes and plugins to work together for a unified experience,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the success of BuddyBoss&#8217; themes and plugins, the company&#8217;s time is still divided 50/50 between product support and custom client work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Custom development generates an important part of our revenue, and our product revenue is quickly catching up,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We actually have two teams, each equipped for development, support and maintenance. I personally manage our product team, while my business partner Tom Chedd manages our client team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of our clients start as customers, and so when we develop products we’re always thinking about how our clients might use them. I think this has contributed to better products, because we actually use what we build,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Focused, Intentional Product Growth</h3>\n<p>In the early days of BuddyBoss, Eisenwasser took a job managing SongLyrics.com. Although he learned some valuable skills from the position, theme development at BuddyBoss was slow for the first few years.</p>\n<p>As product revenue has grown, BuddyBoss is looking to invest in adding more offerings to the store.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve been working hard on assembling a team of talented developers who can help us build more products, however we’d rather spend a couple of months working on a theme than pushing out a bunch of themes fast,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Instead of pumping up the BuddyBoss store with a proliferation of products, Eisenwasser and his team have intentionally kept the number of offerings on the smaller side. For years, their primary product was the original <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/product/buddyboss-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyBoss</a> theme before adding the new <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/product/boss-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Boss</a> theme this year. Branching out into BuddyPress <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> was also a more recent development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boss-1100x760.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boss-1100x760.jpg?resize=500%2C345\" alt=\"boss-1100x760\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-43398\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Designing for social networks requires a lot of thought, and we take our time considering every aspect,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our customers give us all kinds of feedback about what they want, and there are many more themes coming down the road based on what we’ve learned.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Current Landscape of the BuddyPress Theme and Plugin Market</h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that BuddyPress is now an eight-year-old plugin with a solid community of contributors supporting it, the marketplace for BP themes and plugins remains relatively small.

Founder Michael Eisenwasser launched the business in 2010 after discovering BuddyPress while building an international job site to help online workers find employment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;BuddyPress blew me away,&#8221; Eisenwasser said. &#8220;It allowed for a sophisticated and fully customizable membership site while still benefiting from the WordPress ecosystem. We launched our online community almost overnight, and a year later 30,000 people were logging in every day and hiring each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BuddyBoss entered the BuddyPress ecosystem while it was still in its infancy. Eisenwasser saw an opportunity to help other entrepreneurs launch communities by creating products that solved common problems. In addition to the products, his team also offers development for custom requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been focusing on BuddyPress for so long now that I sometimes forget you can run WordPress without it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Growing a Business in a Small Niche</h3>\n<p>As BuddyBoss products are targeted towards a small niche market, hiring has posed a continual challenge for Eisenwasser.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A company is only as good as its employees, and our biggest challenge has always been finding the right people to hire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need talented people who can move the company forward, knowing that we’re in a niche market and skilled developers who understand BuddyPress are harder to find.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s taken us many years to put together our current staff, and even now I still spend a considerable amount of time on hiring and training.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The BudddyBoss team is now up to 14 people who collaborate on design, development, support, and marketing. They currently serve several thousand customers, thanks to tremendous growth over the past couple of years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue is 12.5 times larger today than it was three years ago, and most of that growth has been in the past year,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the past 6 months, product revenue has grown 5 times larger due to improved product offerings, word of mouth from our customers, and better marketing. When I speak of products, I am combining themes and extensions together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently we have several thousand paying customers, with an average checkout order of $130. Many customers purchase two or three products in one order, as we design our themes and plugins to work together for a unified experience,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the success of BuddyBoss&#8217; themes and plugins, the company&#8217;s time is still divided 50/50 between product support and custom client work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Custom development generates an important part of our revenue, and our product revenue is quickly catching up,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We actually have two teams, each equipped for development, support and maintenance. I personally manage our product team, while my business partner Tom Chedd manages our client team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of our clients start as customers, and so when we develop products we’re always thinking about how our clients might use them. I think this has contributed to better products, because we actually use what we build,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Focused, Intentional Product Growth</h3>\n<p>In the early days of BuddyBoss, Eisenwasser took a job managing SongLyrics.com. Although he learned some valuable skills from the position, theme development at BuddyBoss was slow for the first few years.</p>\n<p>As product revenue has grown, BuddyBoss is looking to invest in adding more offerings to the store.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve been working hard on assembling a team of talented developers who can help us build more products, however we’d rather spend a couple of months working on a theme than pushing out a bunch of themes fast,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Instead of pumping up the BuddyBoss store with a proliferation of products, Eisenwasser and his team have intentionally kept the number of offerings on the smaller side. For years, their primary product was the original <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/product/buddyboss-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyBoss</a> theme before adding the new <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/product/boss-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Boss</a> theme this year. Branching out into BuddyPress <a href=\"http://www.buddyboss.com/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> was also a more recent development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boss-1100x760.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boss-1100x760.jpg?resize=500%2C345\" alt=\"boss-1100x760\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-43398\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Designing for social networks requires a lot of thought, and we take our time considering every aspect,&#8221; Eisenwasser said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our customers give us all kinds of feedback about what they want, and there are many more themes coming down the road based on what we’ve learned.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Current Landscape of the BuddyPress Theme and Plugin Market</h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that BuddyPress is now an eight-year-old plugin with a solid community of contributors supporting it, the marketplace for BP themes and plugins remains relatively small. Eisenwasser does not believe that the market is large enough to sustain a full-time theme business, but his team is working to expand its audience outside of the traditional WordPress/BuddyPress community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>BuddyPress has an active developer community and it’s been growing every year.

For example, one may require frequent access to the Posts menu and rarely touch the Appearance menu. Another admininistrator may have a certain custom post type that is accessed more frequently than any other menu item.</p>\n<p>In some cases plugin developers take their liberties placing their menu items at the very top of the admin. Jetpack is a prime example of a plugin that assumes preeminence above Posts, Media, Comments, and other more frequently used publishing items.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Admin Menu Manager</a> is a new plugin that allows you to take control of the admin and order menu items to suit your workflow. The plugin, created by <a href=\"https://spinpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pascal Birchler</a> and the folks at <a href=\"http://required.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">required+</a>, adds a simple drag-and-drop interface for decluttering and reordering menu items.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As you can see in the demo, Admin Menu Manager allows you to drag menu items from top level to a sub-menu or pull sub-menus out to top level for easier access. The plugin is unobtrusive and doesn&#8217;t require its own settings page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got the idea for this particular plugin when I stumbled upon a similar one that used a drag and drop interface just for reordering menu items,&#8221; Birchler said. After searching for other comparable solutions for the admin, he decided to take it one step further and produce a proof-of-concept. The result was a useful new plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I learned that such side projects are great for adapting new technologies and digging deeper into WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is already my third plugin leveraging Backbone.js in my first three months working at required+. Before that I had no idea how to use this library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, I now know that the WordPress admin menu can be quite a mess. I mean, there aren&#8217;t even unit tests for it. I&#8217;ll see how I can change that in core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Birchler said he counts himself lucky that his employer offers him time to work on open source projects.

For example, one may require frequent access to the Posts menu and rarely touch the Appearance menu. Another admininistrator may have a certain custom post type that is accessed more frequently than any other menu item.</p>\n<p>In some cases plugin developers take their liberties placing their menu items at the very top of the admin. Jetpack is a prime example of a plugin that assumes preeminence above Posts, Media, Comments, and other more frequently used publishing items.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Admin Menu Manager</a> is a new plugin that allows you to take control of the admin and order menu items to suit your workflow. The plugin, created by <a href=\"https://spinpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pascal Birchler</a> and the folks at <a href=\"http://required.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">required+</a>, adds a simple drag-and-drop interface for decluttering and reordering menu items.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As you can see in the demo, Admin Menu Manager allows you to drag menu items from top level to a sub-menu or pull sub-menus out to top level for easier access. The plugin is unobtrusive and doesn&#8217;t require its own settings page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got the idea for this particular plugin when I stumbled upon a similar one that used a drag and drop interface just for reordering menu items,&#8221; Birchler said. After searching for other comparable solutions for the admin, he decided to take it one step further and produce a proof-of-concept. The result was a useful new plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I learned that such side projects are great for adapting new technologies and digging deeper into WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is already my third plugin leveraging Backbone.js in my first three months working at required+. Before that I had no idea how to use this library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, I now know that the WordPress admin menu can be quite a mess. I mean, there aren&#8217;t even unit tests for it. I&#8217;ll see how I can change that in core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Birchler said he counts himself lucky that his employer offers him time to work on open source projects. Before he started at required+, the company had no plugins listed on WordPress.org. Now they are up to five after polishing up a few that were lying dormant on GitHub for awhile.</p>\n<p>Version 1 of Admin Menu Manager is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">now available on WordPress.org</a> and the team is working on adding the following features to version 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely remove (and restore) menu items</li>\n<li>Edit existing menu items and their icons</li>\n<li>Add custom items to the admin menu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its current state, the plugin is a good option for re-arranging the admin to suit a client&#8217;s needs or for simply getting Jetpack and other less-frequently used menus out of your way.</p>\n<p>New users often complain about how confusing the WordPress admin can be, especially when many active plugins are adding their own top-level menus.

Whereas previously you might have seen messy unordered lists and BP component UI elements in various states of disarray, the new companion stylesheets resolve many of these issues with BP in use on the default themes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-twenty-fifteen.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-twenty-fifteen.png?resize=1025%2C468\" alt=\"bp-twenty-fifteen\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43320\" /></a></p>\n<h3>A New Approach to User Account / Single Group Navigation Menus</h3>\n<p>If you take BuddyPress 2.3-alpha for a spin, you&#8217;ll notice that the companion stylesheets take a new approach to the user account and single groups navigation, with the primary object nav now displayed vertically on the left.</p>\n<p>The traditional horizontal nav often causes problems, as plugin developers can dynamically add to this menu, pushing it out to two or more rows of menu items. The vertical menus in the stylesheet eliminate the crowding that you often see in the horizontal user/group navigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png?resize=1025%2C792\" alt=\"bp-user-account-nav\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43323\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the most recent <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/companion-styles-an-update/\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> on the task, Ashmore requests that users bear in mind it&#8217;s &#8220;less about theming every aspect as about ensuring a broad sweep on elements to ensure the majority of critical issues are addressed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The primary goal is to make BuddyPress render in a more seamless manner in the default themes. Refined styling to tweak specific BP elements is next on the agenda. If you want to test 2.3-alpha and find that the stylesheets aren&#8217;t loading, make sure to add <code>define (\'SCRIPT_DEBUG\', true);</code> to your <em>wp-config.php</em> file if you want to run trunk directly.</p>\n<p>Contributors working on the companion stylesheet tickets <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/companion-styles-an-update/\" target=\"_blank\">welcome feedback</a> from the community regarding the layout refactoring of the parent theme containers for the BP directories and user account screens, as well as the vertical menu approach. Testing these elements ahead of the BuddyPress 2.3 beta, expected out this week, will help contributors ship more polished stylesheets in the official release at the end of May.</p>\";}i:17;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami 2015 to Experiment with New Tracks, Tickets Selling Out Fast\";s:4:\"guid\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41567\";s:4:\"link\";s:94:\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-2015-to-experiment-with-new-tracks-tickets-selling-out-fast\";s:11:\"description\";s:4934:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wcmia-2015.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wcmia-2015.jpg?resize=750%2C349\" alt=\"wcmia-2015\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39447\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Miami</a>, one of the largest and longest running WordPress events in the US, is gearing up to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-gears-up-for-6th-year-with-new-tracks-and-workshops-planned\" target=\"_blank\">celebrate its 6th year on May 29-31</a>.

Speakers will also move to the Happiness Bar to answer any questions in a non-rushed environment after their sessions are finished.</p>\n<p>For the first time, WordCamp Miami will add an additional developer track on Sunday, which will consist of mini-workshops. In this format, two speakers will be give presentations on a single subject (back-to-back), so attendees will get multiple perspectives on the same subject.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, Andrea Rennick and Jesse Petersen will start off that Sunday with a &#8216;Genesis Framework&#8217; mini-workshop,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;Andrea will introduce the basics and concepts while Jesse afterwards will dive into more advanced topics on Genesis. There are also mini-workshops on building WordPress plugins, the WP-API, and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers are also reaching out to other open source communities to help forge connections across different projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first time, we have a Joomla developer coming to speak on Sunday and talk about Joomla, WordPress, and open source,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;We have been opening our doors to local Joomla and Drupal developers so we are excited about this presentation and hope it’s the start of something bigger for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami is known for its excellent opportunities for networking and will maintain that aspect of the event in 2015.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides knowledge, networking has always been a key reason why people (local or not from the area) attend WordCamps,&#8221; Bisset said. Organizers are tailoring the after-party to be more of a &#8220;networking party&#8221; where attendees can continue their conversations from the event. Networking parties will take place on Thursday evening, Saturday night, Sunday for social breakfast, and a brief ice cream social Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The new venue, Florida International University, is large enough to accommodate the 800+ attendees expected this year. All of the educational and networking opportunities during the 3.5 day event give attendees an incredible value for their tickets, especially for those who are traveling from a distance.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami is an event that traditionally sells out every year and Bisset expects the same for 2015.

The screen, weight, size, and weird keyboard have captured my heart and I&#8217;m enjoying using the machine. It has replaced a 15&#8243; Retina Pro as my primary laptop for about 2 weeks now, with most of that being on the road.</p>\n<p>For better and worse, it&#8217;s a lot like an iPad &#8212; the size and weight feel very natural in your life, and the screen is really gorgeous. It&#8217;s also not worth plugging anything into it besides its charging cable. It feels great to open and pick up right where you left off. The speed feels more than adequate for everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it so far, though I haven&#8217;t tried video editing or photo management outside of the new Apple Photos app. If there was a perfect iPad and keybard combo, it would feel and look like the new Retina Macbook.</p>\n<p>The second thing I&#8217;ll say is I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this laptop for everybody yet. There are some trade-offs, for example I can get 5-6 hours from the battery but it&#8217;s a little shorter than I expected. It&#8217;s refreshing to have a computer that&#8217;s totally silent with no fan, and I&#8217;ve only had a heat warning once when it was sitting in hot direct sunlight for about 20 minutes. I moved into the shade because I was also wilting a bit from the direct LA sun.</p>\n<p>The main reason I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d recommend this Macbook right is hopefully ephemeral: USB-C. One of the very coolest things about the new Macbook is it charges (quickly) with a new standard called USB 3.1 with a Type-C connector, which is open for anyone to use, is reversible, and I think is going to be the future <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/02/usb-history-and-type-c/\">as I&#8217;ve written about on this blog before</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45021\" src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2015/05/USB-type-C-840x321.jpg\" alt=\"USB-type-C\" width=\"840\" height=\"321\" /></p>\n<p>Today, however, USB-C is bleeding edge. I actually have one other device that uses it, Google&#8217;s new Chrome Pixel laptop, but when you search on Amazon for &#8220;USB-C&#8221; there are almost no results except sketchy or not-in-stock generic things, and Apple doesn&#8217;t have any USB-C stuff in stock, even in their stores.

I was able to get a cable that had male old USB and male USB-C on Amazon, that was pretty much it. The promise of USB-C is incredible: standard cables for charging everything super-quickly, a battery pack that could charge your phone or laptop, smaller power bricks, a next-gen Thunderbolt display with one cable for all data, display, and charging.
